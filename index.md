## Technical Background
I've made some games in RPGMaker MV, which uses event-oriented programming.  Dropdown menus are used instead of typing, but it got annoying because if you know what you want to type the menus take longer.
Matlab for a computational neuroscience class.  I would definitely need a refresher if I were to use it again.
Coding in a phonetics program called Praat for linguistics classes.  No idea what language that was, I think it was unique to the program.
I've made excel files with lots of conditionals and nested conditionals.  Not fun to work it, but I did get my files working the way I wanted them to.
In 6th grade computer class the teacher had us download and use Alice.  I think the idea was for us to learn Java, but that did not happen.
