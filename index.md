## Technical Background
I've made some games in RPGMaker MV, which uses event-oriented programming.  Dropdown menus are used instead of typing, but it got annoying because if you know what you want to type the menus take longer.
Matlab for a computational neuroscience class.  I would definitely need a refresher if I were to use it again.
Coding in a phonetics program called Praat for linguistics classes.  No idea what language that was, I think it was unique to the program.
I've made excel files with lots of conditionals and nested conditionals.  Not fun to work it, but I did get my files working the way I wanted them to.
In 6th grade computer class the teacher had us download and use Alice.  I think the idea was for us to learn Java, but that did not happen.

## Project Description
This project is a 2d top-down adventure game.  The player is an alien whose spaceship has crasehd on Earth and now must explore the world looking for parts to fix it.  This project teaches the team how to use Unity for Android game development, github for file sharing, and general project management and teamwork on a project.  The team is using C# in the game creation, which is new to most of the team members and will provide good experience for quickly picking up a new programming language.
An important part of this project will be the inventory management, because different items will be needed to reach new parts of the world and to track game progress as the alien finds more replacement parts for his ship.  It will be important for the game to have an inventory system to track this progress and for the alien to trade other items he collects for new spaceship parts or access to new areas.
The art assets for the tileset and for the player sprite and other sprites are also made for the game by team members, giving experience in 2D pixel art.
